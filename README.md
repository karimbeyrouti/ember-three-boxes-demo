An investigation on how to structure a component framework between EmberJS and ThreeJS. 

Demo here: https://karimbeyrouti.github.io/ember-three-components/

The core components that provide the templating code for THREE.JS has now moved to its 
own addon: https://github.com/karimbeyrouti/ember-three-ui

Based on the work from: https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-three-boxes-demo
