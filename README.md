The core components that provide the templating code for ThreeJS have now moved to an Ember 
addon. The repo is here: https://github.com/karimbeyrouti/ember-three-ui

This is an app with a few demos which are also in the ember addon dummy application.


This started as investigation on how one would structure a component
framework between EmberJS and ThreeJS.
 
Here is the demo: https://karimbeyrouti.github.io/ember-three-components/

It is based on the work from: https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-three-boxes-demo
